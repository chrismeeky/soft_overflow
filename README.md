# Softoverflow
Softoverflow is an application created with the intention of providing solutions to programming problems.

### Vision
Our vision is to be the link between programmers who have questions and the ones who have the solutions

### Technologies

* [Node/Express](https://nodejs.org/en/) A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) The most popular database for modern apps.
