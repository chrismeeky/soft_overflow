# Softoverflow
Softoverflow is an application created with the intention of providing solutions to programming problems.

### Vision
Our vision is to be the link between programmers who have questions and the ones who have the solutions

### Technologies

* [Node/Express](https://nodejs.org/en/) A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) The most popular database for modern apps.
* [Postman](https://getpostman.com/) Used for API documentation. Simplify API development for developers by helping to document APIs.
* [Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com) A project management tool used to manage the app.
